A full-stack web application that simulates an 8-team, double-elimination Dota 2 tournament. Match outcomes are predicted by a neural network trained on historical data using multiple advanced rating systems.

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for predicting Dota 2 match outcomes. It includes scripts to:

1.  **Gather Data**: Fetch thousands of professional match results from the OpenDota API.
2.  **Calculate Historical Ratings**: Process matches chronologically to compute multiple historical skill ratings for each team.
3.  **Train a Model**: Train a PyTorch neural network on the generated dataset to predict win probabilities.
4.  **Simulate a Tournament**: A Flask-based web application provides a Liquidpedia-style bracket interface where users can select 8 teams and run a full tournament simulation based on the model's predictions.

### Features

  - **Automated Data Pipeline**: A bash script automates the entire setup process.
  - **Historical Rating Engine**: Implements Elo (with variable K-factors) and a custom Glicko-2 engine from scratch.
  - **Neural Network Prediction**: Uses a PyTorch model to predict match outcomes based on rating differences.
  - **Interactive Web Interface**: A sleek, Liquipedia-inspired tournament bracket built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - **Full Tournament Simulation**: Simulates a complete 8-team, double-elimination bracket, including upper and lower brackets, to determine a champion.

### Understanding the Rating Systems

A key feature of this project is its use of robust rating systems to quantify team skill. Here’s how they work.

#### **The Elo Rating System**

The [**Elo system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is the foundation of many competitive rating systems, originally designed for chess. Its goal is to calculate the relative skill level of players in a zero-sum game.

  * **Core Concept**: Each team has a rating number. When two teams play, the winner takes points from the loser. The number of points exchanged depends on the difference in their ratings.
  * **Expected Outcome**: If a high-rated team beats a low-rated team, only a few points are exchanged, as this was the expected outcome. However, if the low-rated team causes an upset, it will gain a large number of points.
  * **The K-Factor**: The maximum number of points that can be exchanged is determined by a value called the **K-factor**.
      * A **low K-factor** (like `k=32`, used in this project) leads to smaller, more stable rating changes.
      * A **high K-factor** (like `k=64`) makes the ratings more volatile and responsive to recent results.
        This project calculates both `Elo32` and `Elo64` to feed the model a richer set of features.

#### **The Glicko-2 Rating System**

Developed by Professor Mark Glickman, [**Glicko-2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system) is a significant improvement upon the Elo system because it introduces the concept of **rating uncertainty**. It acknowledges that we can be more or less confident in a team's rating.

Glicko-2 tracks three values for each team:

1.  **Rating (μ)**: This is the skill rating, similar to Elo. It's the system's best guess of a team's strength.
2.  **Rating Deviation (RD or φ)**: This is the measure of uncertainty. An RD is like a margin of error: a low RD means we are very confident in the team's rating (e.g., a veteran team that plays often), while a high RD means the rating is less reliable (e.g., a new team or a team that hasn't played in a long time). **A team with a high RD will see its rating change much more drastically after a match.**
3.  **Rating Volatility (σ)**: This measures the consistency of a team's performance over time. A team with surprisingly erratic results (e.g., beating strong teams but losing to weak ones) will have a high volatility, which causes their RD to increase more quickly.

In essence, Glicko-2 provides a much more nuanced view of skill by not only estimating a team's strength but also how *reliable* that estimation is.
